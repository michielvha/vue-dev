# ⚙️ Vue.js Dev Container Setup

This project uses a **VS Code Dev Container** with a preconfigured Node.js and Vue development environment, powered by Docker.

### 🧠 Requirements
- Docker
- VS Code
- Dev Containers Extension

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Open in VS Code

Make sure you have the Dev Containers extension installed in VS Code.

Then, open the folder:
```bash
code .
```
When prompted, “Reopen in Container”, accept it. VS Code will automatically build the container and set up your environment.



### 🛠️ Initial Setup (if you’re setting it up for the first time)

#### Create the dev container

Create a .devcontainer/ folder and add:

-	devcontainer.json
-	Dockerfile

This repo already includes them.

#### Scaffold the Vue app

Inside the repo root, run:
```bash
npm create vite@latest myapp
```
Follow the prompts (select vue, optionally typescript, etc.).

This creates a Vue 3 app inside the myapp/ directory.


### 📁 Folder Structure

```
vue-dev/
├── .devcontainer/
│   ├── devcontainer.json
│   └── Dockerfile
├── myapp/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

#### ⚡ Features
- Alpine-based Node.js environment
- Git and Bash installed
- Vue CLI and/or Vite support
- Port 5173 automatically forwarded
- Recommended VS Code extensions installed


### 📦 Commands

After the container is ready, go into the app directory:

```bash
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app will be accessible at http://localhost:5173

This is automatically handled in the devcontainer.json

### 🧰 Optional

If you prefer not to use the myapp/ subdirectory, you can move its contents to the root and update devcontainer.json accordingly.


### 🧼 Cleanup

To rebuild the container or fix issues:
```
Dev Containers: Rebuild Container
```
or manually:
```bash
docker rm -f <container-name>
```

**Happy hacking! 💻**
